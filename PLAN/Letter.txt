Auto-resize textarea to fit content (preamble, placeholder, expansions)
http://www.impressivewebs.com/textarea-auto-resize/

Preamble should be fully RHS-like: allow NontermReference, ParamAssignment, ParamReference symbols.
 Treat it as an implied computer-played symbol:
  random @nontermWithPreamble => { @preamble @nonterm }
 Implement using rhsUnexpandedNodes in Rule.prototype.expand
Placeholder, Prompt and Hints should allow ParamReference.

Private nodes, whose immediate text children (preamble, placeholder, terminals) are only visible to owner

Allow arbitrary functions (ParamFunc eval'd in calling scope): $x => $y+$z;  or $x @=> $y+$z;

Role assignment ideas:
 Allow sym_modifiers in grammar (NontermReference in code) to specify a role that overrides nonterminal role
  e.g. "@battle#2" or "@test#3;"
 In Node constructor, parentRole should be replaced by olderSiblingOrParentRole
  i.e. "#=", "#+" and "#-" should be relative to older sibling's role, where available
  this makes for a fairer distribution of turns

Allow weights on human-played rules, determining (a) if rule is visible, (b) what order rules are presented in
 Syntax: "weight_expr => hint => rhs_symbols"

Extend $variable[$#] pseudo-array syntax to allow any index, dynamically computed
  This will require a new kind of ParamAssignment e.g. ArrayParamAssignment, where array index is a ParamFunc
   Ditto a new kind of ParamReference e.g. ArrayParamReference

Role names
 e.g. "roles {Optimist Pessimist}" as alternative syntax to "roles 2"
  can then refer to roles by name e.g. "#Optimist" instead of "#1"
 Drag-and-drop editable role list for Editor
  auto-replace of role names throughout text, when edited

Add missing auto-renaming functionality to Editor (ParamAssignments & ParamReferences in rhs of rules)
