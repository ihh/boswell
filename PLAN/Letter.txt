Rewrite anger.js using $#param; state machine

Sort out hint/weight ambiguity:
 For random nonterms, x=>y interpreted as weight=x,hint=""
 For human nonterms, x=>y interpreted as weight=null,hint=x
 In editor, call weight "Test" and hint "Hint"
 Do not show (or print) "Hint" field for computer, ever
 Always use weightExpr, never default to hint
 Rename CSS: "computerHint" -> "ruleWeight"
 Permanently set CSS class of "Test" to "ruleWeight" (formerly "computerHint")
 Parse hint as PText

Test for obvious and/or potential circular references in makeRhsInputChange

Update debug parse tree to show ".parent", ".enter", ".expand", ".exit" suffices
 If preamble & postamble are empty, fold expansion into parent

Update debug map, isOrphan() (connections from preamble & postamble should be counted)
Fix debug map top & bottom truncated bug

Fix default prompt: "Your move?"

Pause & commit should be defaults.
 Augment syntax with "parallel" (opposite of "pause") and "continue" (opposite of "commit").

Start nonterminal should be computer-playable.

Private nodes, whose immediate text (grandchildren via preamble/postamble/expansion) is only visible to owner


Save player ID in local storage

Auto-resize textarea to fit content (preamble, postamble, placeholder, expansions)

Allow arbitrary functions (ParamFunc eval'd in calling scope): $x => $y+$z; (global)  or $x @=> $y+$z; (local)

Role assignment ideas:
 Allow sym_modifiers in grammar (NontermReference in code) to specify a role that overrides nonterminal role
  e.g. "@battle#2" or "@test#3;"
 In Node constructor, parentRole should be replaced by olderSiblingOrParentRole
  i.e. "#=", "#+" and "#-" should be relative to older sibling's role, where available
  this makes for a fairer distribution of turns

Extend $variable[$#] pseudo-array syntax to allow any index, dynamically computed
  This will require a new kind of ParamAssignment e.g. ArrayParamAssignment, where array index is a ParamFunc
   Ditto a new kind of ParamReference e.g. ArrayParamReference

Role names
 e.g. "roles {Optimist Pessimist}" as alternative syntax to "roles 2"
  can then refer to roles by name e.g. "#Optimist" instead of "#1"
 Drag-and-drop editable role list for Editor
  auto-replace of role names throughout text, when edited

Add missing auto-renaming functionality to Editor (ParamAssignments & ParamReferences in rhs of rules)
