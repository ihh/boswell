At some point during the festivities, ambling from tavern to guild-hall with every appearance of being lost (a routine he had developed to mask an almost-compulsive search for open wine vans), $#self; bumped into a cloaked figure whose back was turned, and muttered an apology; only to find (on recognizing $+self;) that he had violated a long-standing oath never again to extend the courtesies of politeness to his enemy.

Neither had planned this encounter, and each would certainly have avoided the other if they could. And yet, under the circumstances, it was natural for $#self; to feel somewhat annoyed; an emotion he was able to conceal beneath a practiced mask of quiet dignity.

"Peers...?" echoes @other, momentarily confused. "Are we both not noble-born..?"
"But that is precisely my point," continues @self, blithely. "It is well-known that your mother proved entirely unable to moderate her passions in her youth. It is said that she had the sensual appetite of a man, and performed to the satisfaction of several; including (if gossip is not entirely to be mistrusted) a footman and a stable-hand. In view of which, it seems quite possible that you are not showing me the deference appropriate for one of your inferior patrilineage."
$#score += 10;|Insult her age[once] =>"It does not surprise me," says @self, "that in our past interactions, you have demonstrably lacked the vigor required to engage my arguments at a comparable level. Just look at your mother."
"My mother...?" replies @other.
"Precisely! It is well-known that an old cow produces sour milk and sickly calves. So, if we are frank with one another, must we view the issuance of a sickly weakling such as yourself from the loins of a shriveled old hag such as your own mother is easily seen to be."
$#score += 10;|Insult her appearance[once] =>"While I would never judge a book by its cover," says @self, "it has long been my contention that one can judge the erudition of its contents by the appearance of the author."
"A fair point, I suppose..." @other replies, not seeing the trap.
"Well, on this basis," @self continues, "it must go without saying that your intellectual character appears dubious in the extreme. After all, it is probably no exaggeration to call your mother one of the slower-witted human females. Therefore, I feel qualified to doubt your intellectual credentials."|Insult her physical condition[once] =>@self draws a deep breath through pinched nostrils. "It seems to me," he says to @other, "that you are fortunate to be here at all, given the poor health of your mother. On many occasions, well-bred mutual friends have commented to me that she was lucky to survive your birth, given her consumptive frame and weak hips."
$#score += 10;|Insult her taste in wine[once] =>"It seems barely worth talking to you on this subject," sniffs @self. "It is well-known amongst members of my family that those of yours lack even basic appreciation for the finer things in life.
